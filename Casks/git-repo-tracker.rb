  caveats <<~EOS
    git-repo-tracker is a menu-bar app — it has no Dock icon and no main window.

    Launch it like any other app: open it from Launchpad or Spotlight (search
    "git-repo-tracker"), or from a terminal with:
      open -a git-repo-tracker

    Then look for its icon in the menu bar (top-right of the screen). Left-click
    it for the search popover; right-click for the menu. To start it automatically
    at login, turn on "Launch at login" in the in-app Settings.

    Config lives at:
      ~/Library/Application Support/git-repo-tracker/config.yaml
